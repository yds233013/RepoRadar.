# RepoRadar.
**RepoRadar** is an SQL-driven analytics project that dissects GitHub repository activity using PostgreSQL. Through advanced queries, this project explores contributors, commit patterns, timestamp analysis, forks, issues, and repository metadata to deliver deep insights into open-source development behavior.

## 📊 Project Overview

Built in PostgreSQL and Jupyter, this project applies relational queries, CTEs, views, and time-series logic to:
- Track repo creation trends and fork frequency
- Analyze user activity by role and commit behavior
- Surface key statistics about issues, pull requests, and tags
- Use timestamps and intervals to compare developer contributions over time

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored

- 🗓️ What’s the monthly trend of GitHub repo creation?
- 🧑‍💻 Who are the most active contributors by number of commits?
- 🧵 How many issues are created per repo, and how quickly are they closed?
- 🔁 What percentage of repos are forks?
- ⏱️ How does contributor activity change week-over-week?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** (relational database)
- **JupySQL + Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL**: joins, `WITH` clauses (CTEs), `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, timestamps, intervals, filtering
